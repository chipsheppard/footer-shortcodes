Provides Shortcodes to display the Copyright symbol, the Current Year and a site link.

== Description ==

Footer Shortcodes provides an easy way to add the standard footer copyright notice to your website - copyright symbol, Year, Site Title (linked to homepage).

There are separate shortcodes for each element so you can arrange and punctuate them however you like.

There is also a forth shortcode that combines the three elements in the standard way - Â© thisyear siteTitle.

`[footer-shortcode-copyright]` to display the copyright (&copy;) symbol.
`[footer-shortcode-year]` to display the current year.
`[footer-shortcode-site]` to display the site title linked to the homepage.
`[footer-shortcode]` to display all three - symbol year title-link.

Footer Shortcodes uses the PHP date() function so the year will always be current.

Footer Shortcodes will work in content and text widgets only.

Footer Shortcodes will **NOT** work in Titles, WP Custom Fields, Site Title, Site Description, Widget Titles, Menus, Headers and the HTML `<title>` element.
